        <h2><em>What is Css</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Css stands for cascading style sheet</li>
            <li> css describes how html elements are to be displayed on screen,paper or in other media </li>
            <li><span class="item-third">css is not necessary </span><span class="item-fourth"> saves a lot of work.</span>
                it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
            </li>
            <li class="item-five"><em>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</em></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Css can be added to HTML document in 3 ways :</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Inline -by using the style attribute inside HTML elements 1</li>
            <li> internal by using the style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link an external css file</li>
            <li> The most common way to add CSS ,
                is to keep the css style in external CSS files.HOWEVER ,<span class="item-six">in this tutorial we will use Inline
                and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it yourself.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also <br>
            special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.<br><br>
            In Css, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the <br>
            element.<br><br>
            There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commnly used are class and ID. Both are used to elements to which a style should be applied.
